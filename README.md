Problem
The number of unemployed people are rising every day, which costs to a society that are more than just financial. Unemployed individuals not only lose income but also face challenges to their physical and mental health. Societal costs of high unemployment include higher crime and a reduced rate of volunteerism.

Abstract idea

We have decided to make a website that can provide self-employment to people based on their skills. The need of the hour is to provide employment opportunities to the people.  The number of unemployed people is rising every day and it is our duty as responsible citizens to help in the welfare of the people which in turn will contribute towards the development of our nation.
On this website, we will make a login page where people (who require employment) can make their accounts. After that, there will be quick survey questions where we will record their personal details along with their skills- carpentry, electrician, plumbing, tutor, repair, etc.
Similarly, the people (customers) who want to take their services can sign up, and then they can select the required laborer in their area. The laborer can be contacted through his contact number after which he can reach the customer and do the required job. 
This idea will help to solve the problem of unemployment as both skilled and unskilled laborers will be able to get freelancing jobs every day. Moreover, the labour can be employed full-time by a company/firm if needed. To simplify the login task for uneducated people, there will be an option to translate the page in their native language as well as there will be customer care details to help through the login task.
